# Node and PostgreSQL Boilerplate app
## How to set it up
* Clone this repository to your local machine
* Install the dependencies for the project (`npm install`)
* If there are high vulnerabilities reported during the install, run (`npm audit fix --force`)
* Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running
* Create a User for this project ( create user )
* Create a database for the project with your user as the owner ( createdb -U user )
* Rename the `example.env` file to `.env` and update the following fields with your database credentials:
  ```
   MIGRATION_DB_NAME=
   MIGRATION_DB_USER=
   MIGRATION_DB_PASS=
   DB_URL="postgresql://USERNAME@localhost/DATABASE_NAME"
  ```
* Run the command `npm run migrate -- 1` to create the database tables
* run the command `npm t`
* You should see output from 10 integration tests, all passing.
